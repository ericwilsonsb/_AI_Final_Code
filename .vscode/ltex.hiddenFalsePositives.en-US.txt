{"rule":"MORFOLOGIK_RULE_EN_US","sentence":"^\\QThere are some closed form methods for computing filter component values, BUT they are limited to very basic filter shapes (like low-pass, high-pass, symmetric bandpass) AND almost always require a skilled human designer to tune the values afterward.\\E$"}
{"rule":"MORFOLOGIK_RULE_EN_US","sentence":"^\\QOverall Goal of Paper: Develop a machine learning (ML) method to generate filter component values which: can generate filters with much more arbitrary frequency responses (not just simple low-pass, symmetric bandpass, etc.), can accurately account for the higher-order effects which closed-form solutions ignore, significantly decrease the amount of human tuning required by generating more accurate component values.\\E$"}
